# NetworkMetaAnalysis
[in development] A package to take a collection of target-comparator-outcome estimates and produce indirect network meta-analytics estimates across all target-comparator-outcomes

# The data and logic
We produce a bunch of data from the network models than can be stored in a database, and later use to produce plots:

| TCO subset | Network diagram |
| Relative effect estimates | Forest plot |
| Rank probabilities | Rankogram, SUCRA estimates (although not a plot) |
| Posterior parameter draws | |
|    Rhat | Rhat plot |
|    Thinned draws | Trace plots |
|    Density estimates | Density plots |
